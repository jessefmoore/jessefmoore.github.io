•	Reporting design to train/help Blue Teams.

•	Based off the MITRE ATT&CK framework

•	Able to attack Web and Network devices.

•	Able to attack from inside and outside environment

•	Infrastructure for pentesting

•	Metasploit Pro (inside/outside Azure) for Web App/ Network Exploitation.

•	Kali (inside/outside Azure)

•	Empire (PowerShell Post Exploitation)



•	WPScan (WordPress Vuln Scanner)

•	Nikto (Web App Vuln scanner)

•	Responder (Windows Hash harvesting)

•	John (password cracking)

•	HaveIBeenPwned API to check Password reuse.

•	Scripts to perform parts of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

•	Pentesting Lab with VMware Workstation to create replicate Org Environment to perform testing, Join random computer to domain.

•	Test exploits on Operating systems

•	Test Evasion methods on Anti-Virus

•	Test MITRE ATT&CK approach

•	Test automation

•	Pentest standards: http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Main_Page




**Assumptions**

•	Written permission from CISO/Department/Organization to perform pentest.

•	Appropriate Rules of Engagement and Scoping performed before Pentesting/Red Team Ops.



•	Pentest/Red team Ops plan

•	Asset Inventory either in IP Addresses or more broadly the domains.

•	Feed results into Risk Team

•	Feed results into DFIR/Detection Teams with IoC identified and added to Mandiant IOCe

•	Management of reporting/measurements of results
